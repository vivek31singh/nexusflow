    "Initialize the Next.js 14 project structure, install dependencies (lucide-react, clsx, tailwind-merge, etc.), configure strict TypeScript settings with path aliases (`@/`), and set up the Tailwind CSS configuration with the specified fonts (Inter, JetBrains Mono) and design tokens.",
    "Implement the Core Layout Architecture (Phase 2). Specifically, create the `components/ui/panel.tsx` primitive to standardize borders and padding, and build `components/layout/main-layout.tsx` to establish the 4-panel grid system (Workspace, Channel, Main, Agent) with responsive breakpoints for tablet/mobile views.",
    "Define Domain Models and Type Interfaces (Phase 3, Step 1)\n- Create `/types/index.ts`\n- Export interfaces: `Agent`, `Channel`, `Thread`, `Activity`, `WorkspaceState`\n- Export types: `ThreadStatus`, `ActivityType`, `Theme`",
    "Implement the State Management Layer:\n1.  Create `lib/storage-manager.ts`: A utility class wrapping `localStorage` to handle saving/loading of user preferences (e.g., `theme`, `activeWorkspaceId`).\n2.  Create `contexts/workspace-context.tsx`: Set up the `WorkspaceProvider` using React Context API and `useReducer`. Define the reducer to handle actions like `SET_ACTIVE_WORKSPACE`, `SET_ACTIVE_CHANNEL`, `TOGGLE_AGENT_PANEL`, and `SET_THEME`. Initialize state with values from `StorageManager` or defaults.",
    "Implement the MockService layer in `lib/mock-service.ts`. This class should contain methods to fetch Workspaces, Channels, Threads, and Activities with simulated latency (1-5s) and random error rates (~15%). Additionally, implement a `subscribeToActivity` mechanism to simulate real-time data streams for active threads."
