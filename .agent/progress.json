    "Initialize the Next.js 14 project structure, install dependencies (lucide-react, clsx, tailwind-merge, etc.), configure strict TypeScript settings with path aliases (`@/`), and set up the Tailwind CSS configuration with the specified fonts (Inter, JetBrains Mono) and design tokens.",
    "Implement the Core Layout Architecture (Phase 2). Specifically, create the `components/ui/panel.tsx` primitive to standardize borders and padding, and build `components/layout/main-layout.tsx` to establish the 4-panel grid system (Workspace, Channel, Main, Agent) with responsive breakpoints for tablet/mobile views.",
    "Define Domain Models and Type Interfaces (Phase 3, Step 1)\n- Create `/types/index.ts`\n- Export interfaces: `Agent`, `Channel`, `Thread`, `Activity`, `WorkspaceState`\n- Export types: `ThreadStatus`, `ActivityType`, `Theme`",
    "Implement the State Management Layer:\n1.  Create `lib/storage-manager.ts`: A utility class wrapping `localStorage` to handle saving/loading of user preferences (e.g., `theme`, `activeWorkspaceId`).\n2.  Create `contexts/workspace-context.tsx`: Set up the `WorkspaceProvider` using React Context API and `useReducer`. Define the reducer to handle actions like `SET_ACTIVE_WORKSPACE`, `SET_ACTIVE_CHANNEL`, `TOGGLE_AGENT_PANEL`, and `SET_THEME`. Initialize state with values from `StorageManager` or defaults.",
    "Implement the MockService layer in `lib/mock-service.ts`. This class should contain methods to fetch Workspaces, Channels, Threads, and Activities with simulated latency (1-5s) and random error rates (~15%). Additionally, implement a `subscribeToActivity` mechanism to simulate real-time data streams for active threads.",
    "Implement Phase 5 (Component System - Navigation) - Workspace Sidebar. Create `components/workspace/workspace-list.tsx` to render the list of workspaces using data from the context. It should include row-based styling, hover effects, and active state indicators. Additionally, ensure `WorkspaceProvider` is integrated into `app/layout.tsx` to wrap the `MainLayout`.",
    "Implement the Channel Sidebar component (`components/channel/channel-list.tsx`). This component should fetch channels for the `activeWorkspaceId` from the `WorkspaceContext`, list them using the `MockService`, and handle the active channel state. Integrate this component into `components/layout/main-layout.tsx` as the second panel.",
    "Implement `components/threads/thread-list.tsx` to fetch threads based on the `activeChannelId` from the `WorkspaceContext` using `MockService`. It should render a list of threads with their status and title, allow selection of a thread (updating `activeThreadId`), and be integrated into `components/layout/main-layout.tsx` within the MainContent panel."

  "last_commit": "feat: implement ThreadList component and integrate into MainLayout\n\n- Create components/threads/thread-list.tsx to fetch and display threads\n- Add thread selection to update activeThreadId in WorkspaceContext\n- Display thread status with appropriate icons (active, paused, stopped)\n- Show loading skeletons, error states, and empty states\n- Integrate ThreadList into main-layout.tsx MainContent panel\n- Complete the 4-panel navigation flow: Workspace -> Channel -> Thread -> Agent"
