    "Initialize the Next.js 14 project structure, install dependencies (lucide-react, clsx, tailwind-merge, etc.), configure strict TypeScript settings with path aliases (`@/`), and set up the Tailwind CSS configuration with the specified fonts (Inter, JetBrains Mono) and design tokens.",
    "Implement the Core Layout Architecture (Phase 2). Specifically, create the `components/ui/panel.tsx` primitive to standardize borders and padding, and build `components/layout/main-layout.tsx` to establish the 4-panel grid system (Workspace, Channel, Main, Agent) with responsive breakpoints for tablet/mobile views.",
    "Define Domain Models and Type Interfaces (Phase 3, Step 1)\n- Create `/types/index.ts`\n- Export interfaces: `Agent`, `Channel`, `Thread`, `Activity`, `WorkspaceState`\n- Export types: `ThreadStatus`, `ActivityType`, `Theme`"
  ],
  "last_commit": "feat: define domain models and type interfaces\n\nCreate types/index.ts with core interfaces for Agent, Channel, Thread, Activity, and WorkspaceState. Add union types for ThreadStatus, ActivityType, Theme, AgentStatus, and ChannelType. These types form the foundation for type safety across the application."
