    "Initialize the project root by creating the essential configuration files (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.js`, `next.config.js`, `.eslintrc.json`) and the base directory structure (`/app`, `/components`, `/lib`, `/contexts`, `/hooks`, `/types`) as specified in the coding guidelines to establish the development environment.",
    "Create `/types/index.ts` and define the TypeScript interfaces for `Agent`, `Channel`, `Thread`, `Activity`, and `WorkspaceState` exactly as specified in the Technical Specification. Ensure all types are exported and use the specific union types defined (e.g., status strings).",
    "Implement the `MockService` class in `/lib/mock-service.ts`. This class should include methods to fetch Workspaces, Channels, Threads, and Activities with simulated 1-5s latency and a 15% random error rate. It must also implement a `subscribeToActivity` method to simulate real-time updates."
