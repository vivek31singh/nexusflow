  "completed_features": [
    "Initialize the Next.js 14 project structure, install dependencies (lucide-react, clsx, tailwind-merge, etc.), configure strict TypeScript settings with path aliases (`@/`), and set up the Tailwind CSS configuration with the specified fonts (Inter, JetBrains Mono) and design tokens.",
    "Implement the Core Layout Architecture (Phase 2). Specifically, create the `components/ui/panel.tsx` primitive to standardize borders and padding, and build `components/layout/main-layout.tsx` to establish the 4-panel grid system (Workspace, Channel, Main, Agent) with responsive breakpoints for tablet/mobile views.",
    "Define Domain Models and Type Interfaces (Phase 3, Step 1)\n- Create `/types/index.ts`\n- Export interfaces: `Agent`, `Channel`, `Thread`, `Activity`, `WorkspaceState`\n- Export types: `ThreadStatus`, `ActivityType`, `Theme`",
    "Implement the State Management Layer:\n1.  Create `lib/storage-manager.ts`: A utility class wrapping `localStorage` to handle saving/loading of user preferences (e.g., `theme`, `activeWorkspaceId`).\n2.  Create `contexts/workspace-context.tsx`: Set up the `WorkspaceProvider` using React Context API and `useReducer`. Define the reducer to handle actions like `SET_ACTIVE_WORKSPACE`, `SET_ACTIVE_CHANNEL`, `TOGGLE_AGENT_PANEL`, and `SET_THEME`. Initialize state with values from `StorageManager` or defaults.",
    "Implement the MockService layer in `lib/mock-service.ts`. This class should contain methods to fetch Workspaces, Channels, Threads, and Activities with simulated latency (1-5s) and random error rates (~15%). Additionally, implement a `subscribeToActivity` mechanism to simulate real-time data streams for active threads.",
    "Implement Phase 5 (Component System - Navigation) - Workspace Sidebar. Create `components/workspace/workspace-list.tsx` to render the list of workspaces using data from the context. It should include row-based styling, hover effects, and active state indicators. Additionally, ensure `WorkspaceProvider` is integrated into `app/layout.tsx` to wrap the `MainLayout`.",
    "Implement the Channel Sidebar component (`components/channel/channel-list.tsx`). This component should fetch channels for the `activeWorkspaceId` from the `WorkspaceContext`, list them using the `MockService`, and handle the active channel state. Integrate this component into `components/layout/main-layout.tsx` as the second panel.",
    "Implement `components/threads/thread-list.tsx` to fetch threads based on the `activeChannelId` from the `WorkspaceContext` using `MockService`. It should render a list of threads with their status and title, allow selection of a thread (updating `activeThreadId`), and be integrated into `components/layout/main-layout.tsx` within the MainContent panel.",
    "Implement the `ActivityStream` component (`components/activity/activity-stream.tsx`). This component should connect to the `WorkspaceContext` to get the `activeThreadId`, use the `MockService` to fetch historical activities and subscribe to new real-time updates, and render a list of activity items. It must implement auto-scrolling to the bottom when new activities arrive and distinguish between 'log', 'error', 'success', and 'metric' types using specific colors and typography (JetBrains Mono for logs).",
    "Fix the export statements in `contexts/workspace-context.tsx` and `lib/mock-service.ts`. Specifically, ensure `WorkspaceContext` (the context object), `useWorkspaceContext` (the custom hook), and the `MockService` class are properly exported so they can be imported by the consuming components.",
    "Implement Phase 7: Agent Panel & Metrics. Create `components/agents/agent-panel.tsx`, `components/agents/agent-stats.tsx`, and `components/agents/agent-controls.tsx`. These components should display the list of agents, their current status (idle, running, etc.), simulated health metrics, and control buttons. Integrate the `AgentPanel` into `components/layout/main-layout.tsx` as the 4th panel, hooking into the `isAgentPanelOpen` state for collapsibility.",
    "Implement the Command Palette (Ctrl+K).\n1. Create the `hooks/use-keyboard.ts` hook to detect global keyboard shortcuts.\n2. Create `components/overlays/command-palette.tsx` featuring a fixed modal, search input, and list of mock commands (e.g., \"Navigate to Workspace...\", \"Toggle Theme\").\n3. Update `contexts/workspace-context.tsx` to manage the open/closed state of the palette.\n4. Integrate the `CommandPalette` component into `app/layout.tsx` as a global overlay."
