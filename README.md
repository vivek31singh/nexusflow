# nexusflow
NexusFlow is a Discord-inspired, frontend-only Agentic Marketing OS built by dev agents with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It provides a dense, panel-driven interface for orchestrating AI agents across marketing channels and workflow threads, with real-time behavior simulated entirely on the client.
