# Implementation Plan

## Core Features
1.  **4-Panel Navigation System:** Workspace (Left) -> Channel (Mid-Left) -> Content (Center) -> Agent Info (Right).
2.  **Thread Lifecycle Management:** Controls to Start, Pause, Resume, and Stop specific workflow threads with visual feedback.
3.  **Simulated Agentic Activity:** Real-time feed of "Logs" and activities generated by MockService with variable latency.
4.  **Command Palette:** Raycast-style modal (Ctrl+K) for quick navigation and actions.
5.  **Agent Monitoring Dashboard:** Visual display of active agents, success rates, and current status.
6.  **Theme Engine:** Dark/Light mode toggle with persisted state and sub-300ms transitions.
7.  **Robust Notification System:** Toast messages for errors, warnings, and success states.

## User Stories
1.  As a **user**, I want to switch between different Workspaces and Channels quickly so that I can manage different marketing campaigns.
2.  As a **operator**, I want to start a Thread and watch the Agent Activity stream update in real-time so that I can monitor the AI's progress.
3.  As a **power user**, I want to use keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+K) to navigate the interface so that I can keep my hands on the keyboard.
4.  As a **user**, I want to collapse the Agent Panel to give more screen real estate to the Content area.
5.  As a **user**, I want to be notified if an Agent fails or throws an error so that I can take corrective action.
6.  As a **mobile user**, I want to access sidebars via slide-in drawers so that the interface remains usable on small screens.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  **Layout:** The desktop view must render exactly 4 distinct panels with consistent borders and no card-in-card styling.
2.  **Responsiveness:** At <768px, sidebars must be hidden and accessible via drawers.
3.  **Performance:** Theme toggles and micro-interactions must complete in under 300ms.
4.  **Simulation:** MockService calls must delay between 1-5 seconds; activity stream must auto-scroll to bottom when new items arrive.
5.  **Accessibility:** All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible; focus rings must be visible (2px indigo).
6.  **Code Quality:** No use of the `any` type; all imports must use absolute paths (`@/`).
7.  **Visuals:** Typography must strictly follow Inter (UI) and JetBrains Mono (Logs).

## Implementation Steps
**Phase 1: Project Scaffolding & Environment Setup**
Initialize Next.js 14 project, configure TypeScript strict mode, set up Tailwind with the specific design tokens (colors, fonts), and define the strict folder structure.

**Phase 2: Core Layout Architecture**
Implement the 4-Panel Grid System (Workspace, Channel, Main, Agent). Establish responsive breakpoints (Tablet collapse, Mobile drawers). Create the base shell with semantic HTML tags.

**Phase 3: Domain Models & State Management**
Define TypeScript interfaces for Agents, Channels, Threads, and Activities. Implement the StorageManager for data persistence and create the WorkspaceProvider (Context + Reducer).

**Phase 4: Service Layer (Mock API)**
Develop the MockService class with async methods simulating 1-5s latency and 15% error rates. Implement the subscription model for "real-time" activity streams.

**Phase 5: Component System - Navigation**
Build the Workspace Sidebar and Channel Sidebar. Implement row-based lists, hover states, and active indicators.

**Phase 6: Main Content - Threads & Activity**
Build the Thread list and Main Activity Area. Implement the Container/Presenter pattern for the Activity Stream with auto-scroll logic and filtering.

**Phase 7: Agent Panel & Metrics**
Develop the right-hand panel displaying agent status, health metrics, and configuration options. Ensure collapsible functionality.

**Phase 8: Interaction Layer**
Implement the Command Palette (Ctrl+K), Toast Notification system, and Theme Toggle. Ensure focus management and ARIA compliance.

**Phase 9: Simulation & Lifecycle Integration**
Connect the UI to the MockService. Implement Start/Pause/Resume/Stop logic for threads. Visualize loading states (skeletons) and error boundaries.

**Phase 10: Polish & Accessibility**
Refine typography, transitions (<300ms), and keyboard navigation. Perform visual regression and accessibility auditing (WCAG AA).
